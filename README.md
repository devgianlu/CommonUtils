# CommonUtils

[![Codacy Badge](https://api.codacy.com/project/badge/Grade/2567f5fc0fe946cabc73519bd2ac9324)](https://www.codacy.com/manual/devgianlu/CommonUtils?utm_source=github.com&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_content=devgianlu/CommonUtils&amp;utm_campaign=Badge_Grade)

This is a library I use inside many of my Android projects (almost all of them). It includes many useful classes to comply Material Design standards and more.

## Issues
If the issue is under the `com.gianlu.commonutils` package this is the right place to create the issue, if it belongs to another package email me or create an issue on the appropriate repository. 

## Versioning 
I usually edit this library from another project, therefore the commit messages might not be the most descriptive ones.
