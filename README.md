# CommonUtils
This is a library I use inside many of my Android projects (almost all of them). It includes many useful classes to comply Material Design standards and more.

## Issues
If the issue is under the `com.gianlu.commonutils` package this is the right place to create the issue, if it belongs to another package email me or create an issue on the appropriate repository. 

## Versioning 
I usually edit this library from another project, therefore the commit messages might not be the most descriptive ones.
